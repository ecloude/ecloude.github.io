Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher studying how individuals self-regulate their learning to optimize performance with digital learning software. I am affiliated with the [Penn Center for Learning Analytics](https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/index.html) at the University of Pennsylvania with advisor Dr. Ryan Baker. Recently, I was awarded a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship in the [Gamification group](https://webpages.tuni.fi/gamification/) at Tampere University in Tampere, Finland. This research is funded by the European Research Executive Agency and European Commission and the project will entail studying affect, a facet of self-regulated learning, as a non-linear dynamical system using a mixed methods approach with a game-based learning environment.

I earned a Ph.D. in Education and Learning Sciences from the University of Central Florida with advisor Dr. Roger Azevedo. My dissertation focused on studying self-regulated learning as a process using multimodal learning analytics (eye movements, facial expressions of emotions, learner-systems interactions, and physiological data) with multiple learning software, including intelligent tutoring systems, game-based learning environments, and hypermedia-based systems. My B.S. is in Biopsychology from Christopher Newport University. My research has been published or is forthcoming in the International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, and the British Journal of Educational Technology, among other outlets.

My research explores self-regulated learning as a multi-faceted system, encompassing multiple components, including cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational processes, using an interdisciplinary lens and mixed methodology. To collect the process-level data needed to measure and model self-regulated learning facets, my work leverages think-aloud protocols and enriches these verbal expressions of regulation with multimodal data, including eye movements, facial expressions of emotions, physiological data, and log files on learner-system interactions, collected both in the laboratory and in the classroom.

Kippis (cheers in Finnish)!
