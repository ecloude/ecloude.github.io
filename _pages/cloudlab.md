# We are the Computational Learning Organization Using Digital Software (CLOUDS) Lab ☁️

---
Learning is not a single point of data. It is an organized, interconnected, and dynamic system. Like the atmosphere, it is composed of cognitive, metacognitive, affective, and motivational currents.

At the CLOUDS Lab, we model this architecture. We are an interdisciplinary group dedicated to advancing the science of learning by leveraging educational technology, advanced computational methods, and mixed multimodal data.

Our mission is to comprehensively explore the extent to which educational technologies can effectively support the complex organization of teaching and learning. We build and test adaptive, personalized, and context-aware environments designed to support the entire human—their needs, their well-being, and their potential as independent, lifelong learners.

# Our Research
Our work investigates the fundamental question: How can we build learning systems that empower human development and support data-informed educators?

## Pillar I: Modeling the (Whole) Learner
We develop computational models that move beyond simple "knowledge-tacking." Our models integrate the cognitive (what a learner knows), the metacognitive (how they plan and reflect), the affective (how they feel), and the motivational (why they persist) in relation to contextual demands.

## Pillar II: Adaptive & Context-Aware Environments
Learning does not happen in a vacuum. We design and study environments that perceive and adapt to "contextual demands"—from the cognitive load of a task to the socio-emotional climate of a classroom. Our goal is to support learners' self-regulation in real-time.

## Pillar III: Data-Informed Pedagogy & Well-Being
We are committed to empowering educators as data-informed professionals. We build and evaluate tools that make learning data transparent, actionable, and ethical, with a core focus on the well-being and agency of both learners and educators.

# Our Lab Ethos
We believe that a "Team First" mentality and a supportive, rigorous environment are non-negotiable prerequisites for high-impact science. Our culture is our most important system, and we co-revise it as a team.
  1. We Practice Civility: We are respectful of each other's time, working styles (remote/in-person), and perspectives. We are mindful and present in our interactions.
  2. We Celebrate Intellectual Honesty: Mistakes are a natural and celebrated part of the scientific and human experience. Hiding mistakes compromises data, damages collaboration, and is intellectually dishonest. We own our mistakes so we can learn from them.
  3. We Believe Success is Collective: The most successful labs are those where members are genuinely happy for each other's success. We actively share knowledge, help with tasks, and celebrate all accomplishments, large and small.
