Welcome! 

My name is Liz and I am an Assistant Professor of Educational Psychology at Michigan State University, affiliated with the [Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology, and Special Education](https://education.msu.edu/cepse/) in the College of Education. The heart of my research is situated in learning analytics, learning sciences, instructional design and educational technology. My overarching objective is to pioneer intelligent and adaptive learning technologies that bolster the accessibility, inclusivity and overall quality of digital education for everyone, supporting diverse learning needs and reducing learning exclusion and gender inequality. Educational technologies bring to bear capabilities that not only shatter physical barriers to education via digital learning, but the mechanics built into learning systems can be customized to support diverse learning needs.

My work explores SRL as a multi-faceted system, encompassing multiple subsystems, including cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational processes, using an interdisciplinary lens in nonlinear dynamical systems and mixed multi-modal methods. I earned a Ph.D. in Education and Learning Sciences from the University of Central Florida with Dr. Roger Azevedo. My dissertation focused on studying self-regulated learning as a process using multimodal learning analytics (eye movements, think-alouds, facial expressions of emotions, and learner-system interactions) with multiple learning technologies, including intelligent tutoring systems, game-based learning environments, and hypermedia-based systems. In 2022-23, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Penn Center for Learning Analytics](https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/index.html) at the University of Pennsylvania with Dr. Ryan Baker. Finally, from 2023-24, I was a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at Tampere University (Finland) to study emotions as non-linear dynamical systems with game-based learning environments.

My research is supported by the European Union and the Jacobs Foundation and has been published, or is forthcoming, in the International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, and the British Journal of Educational Technology, among other outlets.

Outside of research, I love staying active and being in nature, reading, sports, and music. 

Cheers!
Liz
