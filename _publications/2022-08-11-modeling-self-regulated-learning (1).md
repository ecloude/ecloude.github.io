collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-08-11-modeling-self-regulated-learning
excerpt: 'This paper (1) discusses theoretical, conceptual, methodological, and analytical issues researchers or instructors face when using learners&apos; multimodal data generated from emerging technologies; (2) provides an elaboration of theoretical and empirical psychological, cognitive science, and SRL aspects related to the sketch of the visionary system called SPARC that supports analyzing and improving a learner-instructor or learner-researcher setting using multimodal data; and (3) discusses implications for building valid artificial intelligence algorithms constructed from insights gained from researchers and SRL experts, instructors, and learners SRL via multimodal trace data.'
