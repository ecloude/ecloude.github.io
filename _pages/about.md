Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher applying an interdisciplinary lens and mixed methodology to better understand how individuals self-regulate their learning to optimize performance with digital learning software. I am affiliated with the [Penn Center for Learning Analytics](https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/index.html) at the University of Pennsylvania with advisor Dr. Ryan Baker. Recently, I was awarded a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship in the [Gamification group](https://webpages.tuni.fi/gamification/) at Tampere University in Tampere, Finland. This research is funded by the European Research Executive Agency and European Commission (grant number: 101105874). This project will kick off on Sept. 01, 2023, and study affect, a facet of self-regulated learning, as a non-linear dynamical system using a multi-modal mixed methods approach with a game-based learning environment.

I earned a Ph.D. in Education and Learning Sciences from the University of Central Florida with advisor Dr. Roger Azevedo. My dissertation focused on studying self-regulated learning as a process using multimodal learning analytics with multiple learning software, including intelligent tutoring systems, game-based learning environments, and hypermedia-based systems. My B.S. is in Biopsychology from Christopher Newport University. My research has been published or is forthcoming in the International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, International Conference on Artificial Intelligent in Education, and the British Journal of Educational Technology, among other outlets.

My research explores self-regulated learning as a multi-faceted system, encompassing multiple components, including cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational processes, all of which interact continuously over time and across contexts. To collect the process-level data needed to measure and model self-regulated learning as a multi-dimensional system, my work leverages both quantitative and qualitative measures. Specifically, my work leverages think-aloud protocols and enriches these data further with multimodal data, including eye movements, facial expressions of emotions, physiological data, and log files on learner-system interactions collected in the laboratory.

Kippis (cheers in Finnish)!

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
