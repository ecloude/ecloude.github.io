Hello, I'm Liz, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow affiliated with the [Penn Center for Learning Analytics](https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/index.html) at the University of Pennsylvania with Dr. Ryan Baker. I completed a Ph.D. in the Laboratory for the Study of Metacognition and Advanced Learning Technologies with Dr. Roger Azevedo at the University of Central Florida.

My research program aims to better understand the role of self-regulated learning and its relationship to learning and performance with digital learning software (e.g., game-based learning environments or intelligent tutoring systems). To accomplish this, my work adopts an interdisciplinary perspective by merging self-regulated learning theory with complex systems theory. By relying on tools in non-linear dynamical systems theory, my research explores self-regulated learning as a multi-faceted system, encompassing multiple components: cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational processes, all of which interact continuously over time and across contexts.

To collect the process-level data needed to measure and model self-regulated learning elements as a multi-dimensional system, my work leverages both quantitative and qualitative measures. During my graduate training with Dr. Azevedo, I developed expertise in leveraging think-aloud protocols, a qualitative method for directly accessing self-regulated learning processes during learning activities. The think-alouds were further enriched with multimodal data, including eye movements, facial expressions of emotions, physiological data, and log files on learner-system interactions collected in the laboratory.

During my postdoctoral training, my work has focused on studying self-regulated learning in higher education classrooms such as introductory programming courses. Data collected from learning software that students already utilize in the classroom can harness real-time information on how students self-regulate their learning during programming activities. My primary objective is to design adaptive learning software that autonomously identifies and supports essential learning processes, ensuring optimal performance. Through this work, I aim to influence instructional design and provide valuable insights for instructors in the classroom, to scaffold effective teaching practices and learning strategies.

Recently, I was awarded a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship from the European Research Executive Agency and European Commission. This project will kick off on Sept. 01, 2023, within the [Gamification group](https://webpages.tuni.fi/gamification/) at Tampere University in Tampere, Finland. This research will focus on studying affective dynamics as a non-linear dynamical system using multi-modal mixed methods with a game-based learning environment.


Kippis (cheers in Finnish)!

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
