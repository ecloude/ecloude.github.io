title: "Emotions and the Comprehension of Single versus Multiple Texts during Game-based Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-08-26-emotions-and-comprehension
excerpt: 'The findings of this study highlight several key points:

Learners frequently experience multiple emotions during Game-Based Learning Environment (GBLE) activities.
The emotions expressed by learners during GBLE activities change as they move through different tasks or activities.
The emotions learners experience are connected to their demonstrated comprehension. However, the type of activity they are engaged in affects the nature of this connection.
These study results have important implications:

Researchers and educators should examine how emotions manifest as learners interact with GBLE activities.
Designing GBLEs should take into account the variety of emotions that learners may experience, especially considering the varying demands of different activities.
By considering the emotional aspect and adjusting GBLE design to match activity demands, learners&apos; comprehension of both single and multiple texts can be enhanced.'
