This research project (ID#: 101105874) deals with measuring and modeling emotions as nonlinear dynamical systems that manifest before, during, and after learners' interact with specific game mechanics with a game-based learning environments called [Antidote COVID-19](https://iamtheshield.com/). 

To collect emotions, a mixed-multimodal methods approach is utilized, capturing a range of data channels, including video recordings of facial expressions of emotions and posture, audio recordings of emote- and think-alouds, and computer-screen recordings learner's interactions with game-based mechanics, neuro-imaging data, eye tracking, electrodermal signals, and heart rate during gameplay, and neuro-imaging data (NIRS and EEG). 

These data will be leveraged to study multiple emotional dimensions, including expressive, affective, motivational, neurophysiological, and cognitive elements and their relation to cognitive processing and learning outcomes while learners interact with specific game-based elements.
