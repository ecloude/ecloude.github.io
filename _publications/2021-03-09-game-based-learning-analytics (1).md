title: "Game-based learning analytics for supporting adolescents’ reflection."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-03-09-game-based-learning-analytics
excerpt: 'In this paper, we address these issues by studying the quantity and quality of 120 adolescents’ written reflections and their relation to their learning and problem-solving with Crystal Island, a Game-Based Learning Environment (GBLE). Specifically, we:

1. Define reflection and how it relates to skill and knowledge acquisition.
2. Review studies examining reflection and its relation to problem-solving and learning with emerging technologies.
3. Provide direction for building reflection prompts into GBLEs that are aligned with the learning goals built into the learning session (e.g., learn about microbiology versus successfully solve a problem) to maximize adolescents’ reflection, learning, and performance.

Overall, our findings emphasize how important it is to examine not only the quantity of reflection but also the depth of written reflection as it relates to specific learning goals. We discuss the implications of using game-learning analytics to guide instructional decision-making in the classroom.'
