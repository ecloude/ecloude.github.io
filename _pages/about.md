Tervetuloa (Welcome)! I am a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Faculty of Education and Culture](https://www.tuni.fi/en/about-us/faculty-education-and-culture), and affiliated with the [Gamification group](https://webpages.tuni.fi/gamification/), at Tampere University in Finland. This research is funded by the European Research Executive Agency and European Commission and the project will entail studying affect, a facet of self-regulated learning, as a non-linear dynamical system using a mixed methods approach with a game-based learning environment.

I earned a Ph.D. in Education and Learning Sciences from the University of Central Florida with advisor Dr. Roger Azevedo. My dissertation focused on studying self-regulated learning as a process using multimodal learning analytics (eye movements, think-alouds, facial expressions of emotions, and learner-systems interactions) with multiple learning software, including intelligent tutoring systems, game-based learning environments, and hypermedia-based systems. In 2022-23, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Penn Center for Learning Analytics](https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/index.html) with advisor Dr. Ryan Baker at the University of Pennsylvania.

My research has been published or is forthcoming in the International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, and the British Journal of Educational Technology, among other outlets. My work explores self-regulated learning processes as a multi-faceted system, encompassing multiple subsystems, including cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational elements, using an interdisciplinary lens and mixed methodology. 

Kippis (cheers in Finnish)!
