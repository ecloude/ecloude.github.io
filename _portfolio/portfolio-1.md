This research project (ID#: 101105874) deals with measuring and modeling emotions as nonlinear dynamical systems that manifest before, during, and after learners' interact with specific game mechanics within game-based learning environments called [Antidote COVID-19](https://iamtheshield.com/) and [MediaWatch](https://webpages.tuni.fi/gamelab/2022/mediawatch/)

To collect emotions, a mixed-multimodal methods approach is utilized, capturing a range of data channels, including video recordings of facial expressions of emotions and posture, audio recordings of emote- and think-alouds, and computer-screen recordings of learner's interactions with game-based mechanics, neuro-imaging data (NIRS and EEG), eye tracking, electrodermal signals, and heart rate during gameplay. 

These data will be leveraged to study how multiple emotional dimensions manifest during game-based learning, including expressive, affective, motivational, neurophysiological, and cognitive elements, to assess their relation to cognitive processes and learning outcomes.
