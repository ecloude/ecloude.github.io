Tervetuloa (Welcome)! 

My name is Liz and I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at Tampere University, affiliated with the [Faculty of Education and Culture](https://www.tuni.fi/en/about-us/faculty-education-and-culture) and [Gamification group](https://webpages.tuni.fi/gamification/). The heart of my research is situated in learning analytics, learning sciences, instructional design, and educational technology. My ultimate goal is to develop intelligent and adaptive learning technologies that enhance the accessibility, inclusivity, and overall quality of digital education, making the benefits of self-regulated learning (SRL) accessible to everyone. My work explores SRL as a multi-faceted system, encompassing multiple subsystems, including cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational processes, using an interdisciplinary lens in nonlinear dynamical systems and mixed multi-modal methods. 

I earned a Ph.D. in Education and Learning Sciences from the University of Central Florida with Dr. Roger Azevedo. My dissertation focused on studying self-regulated learning as a process using multimodal learning analytics (eye movements, think-alouds, facial expressions of emotions, and learner-system interactions) with multiple learning technologies, including intelligent tutoring systems, game-based learning environments, and hypermedia-based systems. In 2022-23, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Penn Center for Learning Analytics](https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/index.html) at the University of Pennsylvania with Dr. Ryan Baker.

My research is supported by the European Union (Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions programme) and the Jacobs Foundation. My research has been published or is forthcoming in the International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, and the British Journal of Educational Technology, among other outlets.

Outside of research, I love staying active and being in nature, reading, sports, and music. 

Kippis (cheers in Finnish)!
Liz
