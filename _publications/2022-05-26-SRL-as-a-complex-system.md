title: "Capturing Sequences of Learners' Self-Regulatory Interactions With Instructional Material During Game-Based Learning Using Auto-Recurrence Quantification Analysis"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-05-26-SRL-as-a-complex-system
excerpt: 'While previous studies have examined SRL using NDST methods (Garner and Russell, 2016), few studies in SRL literature: (1) examine how SRL strategies are deployed during game-based learning (Cloude et al., 2020; Taub et al., 2020; Dever et al., 2021); (2) operationalize SRL as a sequence of dynamic, temporally unfolding processes and examine the direct relationships between these processes simultaneously using eye tracking data; and (3) use an NDST approach to analyzing how SRL occurs during learners&apos; time in a GBLE. The goal of this study was to address these gaps in current literature by examining SRL using the lens of complex systems theory and analytically investigate how learners use SRL strategies within a GBLE through applying NDST methods.'
