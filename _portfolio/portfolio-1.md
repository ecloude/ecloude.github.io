Research Project Abstract: 

A UN Sustainable Development Goal is to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. The project results contribute to improving the future of education for all and have direct scientific, societal, and technological impacts. Current education solutions are limited to a one-size-fits-all paradigm, unable to support diverse learning needs, and contribute to learning exclusion and gender inequality. State-of-the-art (SOA): Game-based learning environments (GBLEs) bring to bear capabilities that not only shatter physical barriers to education via digital learning, but game mechanics built into GBLEs can be customized and adapted to support diverse learning needs. Game mechanics are important because they sustain learners’ engagement and interest in learning activities, which elicit cognitive processes that water the seeds of learning. Still, more research is needed to develop adaptive game mechanics to support diverse learning needs. The mission of this research is to study interactions between game mechanics and emotions as a non-linear dynamical system and observe the impact of such interactions between diverse learners’ cognition and learning outcomes with GBLEs.

In this research project, we will conduct a within-subjects mixed-methods study design to observe relations between game mechanic interactions and in-game emotions, cognition, and learning outcomes by collecting multiple data channels. Specifically, we will recruit 120 university students (50% women) from Tampere University and they will be asked to learn with multiple game-based learning environments called XX. Prior to gameplay, a series of survey measures and prior knowledge assessment will be collected, and during gameplay, interaction data (i.e., log files) and multimodal time series data will be captured (i.e., video, audio recordings of think-alouds, computer screen recordings, facial expressions, electrodermal activity, and heart rate). After gameplay, all participants will be asked to complete a knowledge assessment of material they learned in the game, and survey measures. Next, the project will merge the component process model of emotion and complex systems theory to examine the temporal emergence of emotions over the course of interacting with game mechanics using nonlinear dynamical analyses.

Theoretically, the project will advance game-based learning research by merging an interdisciplinary approach to gain fresh insights on how to emotions emerge in relation to learners’ interactions with game mechanics that foster engagement, cognition, and learning. Methodologically, this project will contribute advancing the measurement and modelling of emotions and their dynamics. Practical guidelines for designers, educational game companies, instructors, and researchers on how to leverage adaptive game mechanics that support an inclusive, equitable, and high-quality, GBLEs designed to support diverse learning needs. The results of this project will allow for the further development of game mechanics that fostering specific emotions (e.g., joy, frustration) that benefit cognition and learning based on diverse learning needs.
