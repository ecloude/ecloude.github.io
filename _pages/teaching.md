## Teaching as Applied Learning Science

The laboratory studies the *architecture* of learning. The classroom is where we *build* and *test* its effectiveness. 

I view teaching not as a simple transfer of information, but as the active design and facilitation of a complex, context-aware learning environment. 
This approach demands that I practice what my lab preaches: I must be adaptive, data-informed, and, above all, focused on the well-being and agency of the learners in the system.

## My Teaching Philosophy

My pedagogical approach is built on three core, non-negotiable principles that directly reflect our lab's research.

### 1. Learning How to Learn (Metacognition & Regulation)
The most durable skill I can teach is not a specific fact or theory, but the ability to learn *how* to learn. My courses are explicitly designed to scaffold and model **metacognitive regulation**. Students are consistently asked to plan their approach, monitor their understanding, evaluate their strategies, and reflect on their failures. We treat "stuck" not as a failing, but as a critical data point that signals an opportunity for a new strategy.

### 2. Technology as a Lever, Not a Panacea
As a computational learning scientist, I am deeply skeptical of technological solutionism. The "Digital Software" in "CLOUDS" is a tool, not a replacement for human connection or rigorous thought. In my courses, we use technology as a **lever to amplify human capability**—to automate trivial tasks, to visualize complex systems, and to provide personalized feedback with a human-in-the-loop. We also, as a core competency, critically analyze these tools for their inherent biases, ethical implications, and sociotechnical impact.

### 3. The Rigor of an Inclusive Environment
The "Organization" in "CLOUDS" is fundamentally human. My classroom, like my lab, is a **"Team First" environment**, but one that holds us to the highest intellectual standards. I believe rigor and psychological safety are mutually dependent. A classroom where students are afraid to be wrong is not a classroom where meaningful learning can readily occur. We foster an environment of **intellectual honesty** and **epistemic humility**, where we can challenge ideas, celebrate mistakes as learning opportunities, and hold each other accountable for the quality of our work.

## Courses

My course offerings span the intersection of educational psychology, learning science, and educational technology. *Note: Course availability is subject to university scheduling.*

### Graduate Seminars

* **[CEP 903] Cognitive development across the Lifespan:** This course moves beyond traditional "stage-based" models of cognitive development to explore the complexity of cognitive development. We build and critique models that integrate cognition as a complex dynamical system.
* **[CEP 930] Education Inquiry:** A methods course for educational researchers where we design, build, and test research projects to study learning and teaching.

### Undergraduate Courses

* **[CEP 416] Teaching and Learning with Technology:** This course is designed to provide hands-on activities to promote the effective use of educational technology to support teaching and learning, including game-based learning environments and AI chatbots.

## Student Resources & Open Pedagogy

I am a firm advocate for **Open Science** and **Open-Source Software**. Where possible, my course materials, syllabi, and reading lists are made publicly available. Please email Dr. Cloude if you cannot find a syllabus and would like to learn more about a course!
