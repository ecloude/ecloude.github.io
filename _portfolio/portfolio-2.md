The overall objective is to build, Flora Fox, a software for trace-based and comprehensive measurement of secondary students’ self-regulated learning during writing tasks. It employs a mixed-methods approach that utilized data-driven interviews. This project was funded by the Jacob's Foundation and involves researchers at Monash University (Australia), Tampere University (Finland), and University of Tübingen (Germany).

State-of-the-art methods for measuring self-regulated learning (SRL) involves collecting students interactions (log files) with a digital platform. Even though trace-data may provide deep insights into what learners are doing, this data often cannot explain why learners made particular learning decisions, i.e., it cannot reveal learners’ motivation to engage in particular learning processes. To address this methodological gap, we will integrate [Flora](https://floraproject.org/website/), a technology-enhanced learning environment embedded into the Moodle Learning Management System with Quick Red Fox [(QRF)](https://github.com/pcla-code/QRF), a mobile-app that alerts a researcher to key moments in a learner's self-regulated learning processes, e.g., the occurrence of a critical SRL behaviour/ sequence of behaviours.

In this way, we will develop Flora Fox, an innovative software that integrates Flora and Quick Red Fox (QRF) functionalities to allow for data-driven interviewing and advance our understanding on motivation and its role in self-regulation during learning.
