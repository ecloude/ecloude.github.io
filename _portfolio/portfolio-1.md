This research project deals with measuring affective and cognitive processes that manifest before, during, and after learners' interact with specific game mechanics with a game-based learning environments called Antidote COVID-19 (see Image above). To collect affective and cognitive processes, a mixed-methods approach is being utilized, capturing a range of data channels, including video recordings of facial expressions of emotions and posture, audio recordings of emote- and think-alouds, and computer-screen recordings learner's interactions with game-based mechanics, neuro-imaging data, eye tracking, electrodermal signals, and heart rate during gameplay. These data will be leveraged to study how affective and cognitive processes emerge while learners interact with game-based elements and its relation to learning and knowledge outcomes.
